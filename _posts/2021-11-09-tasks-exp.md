**Hello There**, I am Himanshu Lath. A student form Amrita University, Amritapuri and an aspiring amFOSS member.

## About Blog

So, What is this blog about. Hmm, What is it's use indeed..!!

Well... To be frank.. It's of no use.. I was just trying out new thing and ended up using Ruby here.. First time writing something like this.. And it happens to be on Ruby.. Well since we are here anyways.. Let me share my experience while doing amFOSS Tasks..

## About the Tasks

So.. About the tasks huh.. Let's start by taking an objective look at all the tasks..

Looking Objectively.. The tasks are designed so that one can learn Things.. Even if he/she does not a thing about it prior to it, doesn't matter.. Every task comes with there set of resources and all of them has a purpose. The rule is simple.. If YOU want to know about something you will get it.. Coz your desire to find about it will lead you to your goal eventually.. What's needed is the hunger for the knowledge.

## My Experience

What.. My Experience... So.. If I have to describe my experience about the tasks nah.. I Would say they were just what a growing student needs, I would go as far as to state them as perfect. I really loved all the tasks.. Just seeing them one can say that a lot of effort into thinking and creating these tasks.. And none has gone to waste.. Whoever does it.. Will think so. These tasks are not made for someone who is half-assing.. You gotta be serious.. And If you are.. You will feel the tasks..
